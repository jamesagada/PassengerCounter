### Goal
Developing a Passenger Counter (PCN) in a transportation environment using OpenCV and its hardware acceleration capabilities on different hardware platforms.

### Hardware
* Eurotech ReliGATE 20-25 (Intel E3827 Atom Processor)

Video acquisition:
* Logitech Quickcam Pro 5000 driverless webcam

### Software platform
[Here](https://github.com/mattdibi/RSPassengerCounter/tree/master/build_config) you can find the instructions for building the Yocto distribution supporting the PCN application. It is needed to run the application on Eurotech's ReliaGate 20-25.

### Tools
For the development I've used:
* Yocto Project
* OpenCV
