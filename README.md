# Passenger Counter (PCN)
This is going to be my Electronics Engineering Master's Thesis.

### Goal
Developing a Passenger Counter (PCN) in a transportation environment using OpenCV and its hardware acceleration capabilities on different hardware platforms.

### Hardware
I'm going to explore different solutions to achive this goal. 
* Zedboard Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC
* Zybo Zynq-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC Trainer Board
* Eurotech ReliGATE 20-25 (Intel E3827 Atom Processor)
* Raspberry Pi (?)

Video acquisition:
* Webcam
* ...?

### Tools
For the development I'm going to use:
* Xilinx SDSoC Developement Environment
* Yocto Project
* OpenCV
* ...?
